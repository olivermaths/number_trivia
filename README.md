    I developed this application a while ago while I was studying how to use TDD (Test-driven-domain) and Clean Architecture in Flutter Apps.

# How to build
</h2>

---
It is pretty simple to build and install this app, just use the standart Flutter commands.
You may want to run it before to collect shaders to improve perfomance (even thought it is a pretty, very simple app, so you probably don't need to do that).

inside de project root directory run:

```
flutter build --release apk
```
